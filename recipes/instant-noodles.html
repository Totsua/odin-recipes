            <li>Boil the kettle with atleast 400ml of water</li>
            <li>Open the instant noodles packet and place the noodles in a bowl. Leave the seasoning it comes with
                on the side for now.</li>
            <li>Once the water is boiled, pour 250ml in the bowl with the noodles. Place the bowl in the microwave
                for 1 1/2 minutes at 800W.</li>
            <li>Whilst it heats in the microwave, heat a frying pan with some butter on high and let the butter
                melt. Crack the 2 eggs into the pan and let that sit.</li>
            <li>Chop up the 2 frankfurters whilst waiting for the microwave.</li>
            <li>When the microwave beeps, take the bowl out and place the packet seasonings into the noodles along
                with the frankfurters.</li>
            <li>Place the bowl back in the microwave for 1 minute.</li>
            <li>Check on the progress of the egg, once the egg is cooked turn off the heat and let it sit in the pan.</li>
            <li>When the microwave is finished, take out the bowl and place the eggs on top of the noodles and enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
